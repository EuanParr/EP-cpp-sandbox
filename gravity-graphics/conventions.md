Naming conventions:
filenames are lower-case with underscores like 'example_file.h'
C++ files are .cpp and have .h files of the same name.
both have top-level namespaces of the same name - this may not be common
practice for C++ but I like Python's 'files are namespaces' system.

variable and function names are lower camel case,
class and struct names are upper camel case

otherwise use outside convention
